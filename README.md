(that is if i still have it deployed)

To run this App

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database

## Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`

## Description

CRUD app created with react that displays pictures of guitars I one day hope to own in each of the components. I enjoyed setting up the different axios requests and also enjoyed the challenge of useing react in a solo setting for a full crud app for the first time.
